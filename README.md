# My GitHub Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! Below you will find a collection of my projects related to vehicle dynamics, data analysis, machine learning, and more. These repositories showcase the work I've done in various areas of vehicle behavior modeling, simulation, and control systems.

## Projects

### [Make Measurement](https://github.com/techguru-nya/make_measurement)
This project involves the creation of measurement files (.cfg) for vehicle dynamics. It includes functions for reading A2L files, filtering signals based on keywords, and adding required signals from PLT files.

### [Make Torque Model](https://github.com/techguru-nya/make_torque_model)
In this project, I estimate wheel torque from real-world data using MATLAB. The goal is to create a wheel torque model using motor torque, wheel speed, and other vehicle parameters through deep learning techniques.

### [VDC Robust Tool](https://github.com/techguru-nya/vdc_robust_tool)
This project focuses on analyzing the intervention characteristics of Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC). The tool examines excessive control or early activation of VDC and helps fine-tune the VDC behavior.

### [Auto Calibration with CarSim](https://github.com/techguru-nya/autocalibration_carsim)
This repository features an auto-calibration tool for ESP (Electronic Stability Program) using CarSim simulations. It incorporates parameter tuning with Optuna and MATLAB integration to improve vehicle stability control.

### [Acceleration Model](https://github.com/techguru-nya/acceleration_model)
The acceleration model project estimates vehicle acceleration by tuning parameters based on real-world data. It uses techniques such as Linear Regression to optimize model performance.

### [Analysis Robustness Test](https://github.com/techguru-nya/analysis_robustness_test)
This project focuses on analyzing the robustness of vehicle behavior models. It tests different parameters and evaluates how they affect the stability and performance of vehicle dynamics models.

### [Data Utils](https://github.com/techguru-nya/data_utils)
The Data Utils repository provides utilities for reading and processing measurement data. It includes functions for converting data to CSV, reading comments, and handling parameter files for simulation and analysis.
